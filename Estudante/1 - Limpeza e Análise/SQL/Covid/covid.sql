/* Questions I will answer using public datasets on covid-19 in Brazil:

1. What has been the percentage of infected people that gets to occupy a hospital bed?
2. How does the lethality for people occupying a hospital bed compares to those in general affected by covid?
3. How has the occupation of hospital beds because of covid been varying over time?

* All of these questions will be answered by state or for the whole country.
